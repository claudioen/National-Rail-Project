### Introduction
Project delving into NationalRail's data ‚Äì uncovering key insights into train operations in England, Scotland, and Wales.

### Objectives
1. Discovering busy routes üõ§Ô∏è
2. Pinpointing peak travel times ‚è∞
3. Analyzing ticket revenues üí∞
4. Assessing on-time performance ‚è±Ô∏è

### Data Description
The dataset contains mock train ticket sales for National Rail in the UK, covering the period from January to April 2024. It includes detailed information on:
* Type of Ticket: The category of each ticket sold.
* Journey Date & Time: The specific date and time for each journey.
* Departure & Arrival Stations: The starting and ending points of each journey.
* Ticket Price: The cost of each ticket.
* Additional Details: Any other relevant information associated with the train ticket sales.
The dataset was initially fairly clean but incomplete, lacking the coordinates for various railway stations.
These coordinates were obtained from the following source: https://github.com/ellcom/UK-Train-Station-Locations/blob/master/uk-train-stations.csv
